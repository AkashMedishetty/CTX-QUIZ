# SSL Certificate Directory

This directory should contain your SSL certificates:
- fullchain.pem - Your SSL certificate chain
- privkey.pem - Your private key

For development, you can generate self-signed certificates:
```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout ssl/privkey.pem \
  -out ssl/fullchain.pem \
  -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Organization/CN=localhost"
```

For production, use Let's Encrypt or a commercial certificate.
See docs/ssl-setup.md for detailed instructions.

DO NOT commit actual certificate files to version control!
